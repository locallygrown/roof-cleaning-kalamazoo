# README

This is my first Ruby Rails project and I am very exited to be doing this for my Kalamazoo roof cleaning business. I usually use Wordpress but am trying my hand at this instead to see if I am able to build, optimize, and rank a website this way.

I don’t know much about programming and web development by I am learning. But I DO know quite a bit about [roof cleaners in Kalamazoo](http://roofcleaningkalamazoo.com). It seems everyone in Michigan wants to be a roof cleaner these days. It’s good business for sure. 

Anyway, back to the technical stuff. I am really looking forward to this project and hope it will be the next big thing on my technical education that I can utilize to propel my [roof cleaning Kalamazoo](http://roofcleaningkalamazoo.com) business.
